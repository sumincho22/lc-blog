# Description
- Buy low, sell high
    - Keep two pointers, left and right, to maintain low and high points in the market
    - if prices[l] < prices[r], we get a net increase
    - other wise, we want to move l to r and increase r by 1

# Code
{% highlight ruby %}
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    l, r = 0, 1
    
    maxP = 0
    
    while r < len(prices):
        if prices[l] > prices[r]:
            l, r = r, r + 1
        else:
            profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
            maxP = max(maxP, profit)
            r += 1
    return maxP
